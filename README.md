The entire optimization process is divided into four stepsã€‚The first step involves the initialization of the population individual parameters, which is carried out in the main_program. The second step performs simulated binary crossover and polynomial mutation on the parent population to enhance genetic diversity, and this is implemented in the genetic_operator program. The third step conducts time-domain solving for each population individual, completes the design of the magnetic components, and calculates the efficiency and volume, which is executed in the Cal_Loss program. The fourth step involves non-dominated sorting of the population individuals, which is performed in the NDS_CD_cons program. The tour_selection program selects the next parent population based on the elite retention strategy.
